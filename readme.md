Shell Adventure
===============

Shell Adventure is an idea for a small text game, played from the terminal
through the use of basic UNIX and shell (bash or zsh) commands. It's a linear
adventure through a dungeon where the main objective is to teach the player
the basics of using the terminal.

``shell_adventure.pdf`` contains the objectives and layout of the dungeon
poorly drawn by me.
